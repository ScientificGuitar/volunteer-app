# Rosterly
*A simple volunteer scheduling platform for community organizations.*

## Overview
Rosterly is a volunteer scheduling application built for organizations that coordinate people across events, recurring shifts, and day-to-day operations.  
The goal is to make volunteer coordination simple.  
Many organizations still rely on spreadsheets, group chats, and email chains to organize volunteers. Rosterly replaces that with a focused scheduling tool designed specifically for volunteer teams.

### Potential users
- Charities
- Churches
- Food banks
- Animal shelters
- Community outreach groups
- Event organizers
- Local nonprofits

# Product Vision
The core problem Rosterly solves:  
> Coordinators need to create shifts. Volunteers need to sign up. Everyone needs visibility into who is covering what.  
Rosterly should make this easy for both sides.

### Organizers
- Create events
- Create shifts
- Manage volunteers
- Track coverage

### Volunteers
- View available shifts
- Sign up quickly
- Get reminders
- Know where they need to be


# MVP Scope
The MVP is focused entirely on scheduling.  
No payroll, messaging platform, donation management, or unnecessary admin features.


## Organization Management
- Create organization
- Organization profile/settings
- Organization dashboard


## Events
Organizers can create events such as:
- Saturday food bank
- Sunday welcome desk
- Animal shelter morning shift
- Community cleanup day

### Event fields
- title
- description
- location
- date
- start time
- end time

## Shift Slots
Each event can contain one or more volunteer slots. For example:  
Saturday Food Bank:  
- 08:00–10:00 → 4-5 volunteers
- 10:00–12:00 → 4-6 volunteers
- 12:00–14:00 → 3 volunteers

### Slot fields
- start time
- end time
- volunteers required (minimum - maximum)
- notes (optional)

## Volunteer Signup
Volunteers can:
- open signup link
- enter name
- enter email
- select shift
- receive confirmation email

### Important
For MVP, volunteers should **not** be forced to create an account.  
Low-friction signup is a priority.

## Organizer Dashboard
Organizers can:
- view upcoming events
- see who signed up
- see which shifts are full
- see which shifts still need volunteers
- cancel or manage signups
- export volunteer list

## Email Notifications
Automated emails:
- signup confirmation
- cancellation confirmation
- shift reminder

If Rosterly removes the need for spreadsheets, endless group messages, and manual follow-up, it is doing its job.
