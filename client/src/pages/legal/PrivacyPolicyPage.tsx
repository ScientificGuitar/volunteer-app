          {OPERATOR_NAME} (“we”, “us”) decides how the service operates and is
          the <strong>data controller</strong> for organizer account data and

          For volunteer signup data (names, email addresses, and signup
          status), we act as a <strong>data processor / service provider on
            behalf of the organization</strong> running the event: the
          organization decides which events to run and who to invite, and we
          store and email that data only to operate the roster for them. The
          organization is the controller of its volunteer roster, and
          volunteers can exercise their rights against either the organization
          or us — see section 9.

        <p>
          <strong>Organizers (via Clerk authentication).</strong> When you
          create an account and sign in, our authentication provider Clerk
          shares your account identity with us: a Clerk user identifier and
          the email address on your account. We also store your organization
          name and the events, time slots, and invite links you create.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Volunteers (no account).</strong> When you sign up through
          an invite link we collect the name and email address you enter, the
          slot you chose, your signup status (pending, confirmed, cancelled,
          or removed), and timestamps (created, confirmed, reminder sent). We
          store a salted SHA-256 hash of your personal manage token — never
          the token itself — so we can recognize your manage link without
          keeping a copy of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Email records.</strong> To deliver confirmations, reminders,
          and cancellation notices reliably, each signup email is stored as a
          delivery record (recipient, subject, message body, and any calendar
          `.ics` attachment) until it has been sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Technical data.</strong> Our servers and hosting
          infrastructure process standard technical data needed to operate
          the service, such as IP addresses and request logs. We do not use
          advertising trackers and do not sell personal data.

          <li>
            <strong>Running the roster (contract / legitimate interests, GDPR
              Art. 6(1)(b)–(f)).</strong> Storing events, slots, and signups;
            enforcing slot capacity; showing organizers their roster.

          <li>
            <strong>Confirming signups and preventing abuse (legitimate
              interests, Art. 6(1)(f)).</strong> Email confirmation links keep
            mistyped and fake addresses out of rosters; manage-token hashes
            let volunteers manage their own signups securely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sending service emails (contract / consent, Art.
              6(1)(a)–(b)).</strong> Confirmations, pre-shift reminders, and
            cancellation notices. Volunteers receive these because they asked
            to sign up; marketing emails are never sent to volunteers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication and security (contract / legal obligation,
              Art. 6(1)(b)–(c)).</strong> Verifying organizer identity through
            Clerk and keeping accounts secure.

          <li>
            <strong>Legal compliance (Art. 6(1)(c)).</strong> Retaining records

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where consent is the basis (for example reminder emails tied to a
          voluntary signup), you can withdraw it at any time by cancelling
          the signup through your manage link.

          We use only cookies that are strictly necessary to operate the

          that keep organizers signed in and protect against misuse. We do
          not set advertising or cross-site tracking cookies, and volunteers
          browsing or signing up through a public invite link are not tracked
          for advertising.

      <LegalSection id="sharing" title="5. Who we share data with">

          We share personal data only as needed to run the service, and never
          sell it or share it for someone else’s marketing:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clerk — authentication (processor).</strong> Organizer
          sign-in is handled by Clerk, Inc. (USA). What is shared: your
          login identity (Clerk user ID, email address, session data) so we
          can verify who you are and which organization you own. Clerk
          processes this under its own{" "}

            legal hub

          . Clerk’s data-sharing rules: it does not sell personal data, uses
          sub-processors for infrastructure, and discloses data only as its
          policy describes (to provide the service, for security and legal
          compliance, or with consent).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resend — email delivery (processor).</strong> Volunteer
          emails are sent by Resend (Plus Five Five, Inc., USA) on our
          behalf. What is shared per email: the recipient address, subject,
          message body (which includes the volunteer’s name, event details,
          and manage link), and any `.ics` calendar attachment. Resend
          processes this under its{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Organizations see their own roster (separate
            controllers).</strong> An organizer can see the names, email
          addresses, and statuses of volunteers who signed up for their
          events, and can export that list. Volunteers: by signing up, you
          understand the organization running the event receives the details
          you enter. Organizations must use roster data only to run their
          events (see our Terms of Service) and handle any copies they export
          responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hosting and infrastructure.</strong> Data is stored in our
          PostgreSQL database wherever the {OPERATOR_NAME} instance is
          hosted by its operator. No other third party receives personal data
          unless required by law or strictly necessary to keep the service
          running — in which case we will inform you if the law allows it.

      <LegalSection id="transfers" title="6. International transfers">
        <p>
          Clerk and Resend are based in the United States, so organizer
          identity data and volunteer email content are transferred to and
          processed in the US. Both providers support recognized safeguards
          for such transfers: Clerk participates in the EU–US Data Privacy
          Framework and offers standard contractual clauses (see its{" "}
          <ExternalLink href="https://clerk.com/legal">
            legal hub
          </ExternalLink>
          ), and Resend offers standard contractual clauses in its{" "}
          <ExternalLink href="https://resend.com/legal/dpa">
            Data Processing Addendum
          </ExternalLink>
          . Where the service database itself is hosted also determines where
          roster data rests — organizers operating in the EU/UK should take
          this into account for their own records.

      <LegalSection id="retention" title="7. How long we keep data">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Volunteer signups</strong> are kept as part of the
            organizer’s roster history until the organizer deletes the event
            or organization, or a deletion request is granted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email delivery records</strong> are kept until sent plus a
            short operational window for debugging delivery failures, then
            removed through routine cleanup.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organizer accounts</strong> (organization name, Clerk user
            ID) are kept while the account exists and removed within a
            reasonable period after deletion, except where the law requires
            longer retention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exported copies are the organizer’s responsibility — deleting
            data in {OPERATOR_NAME} does not delete copies an organizer
            previously downloaded.

      <LegalSection id="security" title="8. Security">
        <p>
          We protect personal data with measures including transport
          encryption, organizer ownership checks on every admin request,
          SHA-256 hashing of volunteer manage tokens (so a database copy alone
          cannot reconstruct manage links), and least-access handling of
          credentials. No system is perfectly secure, so if you suspect
          misuse of a manage link or account, cancel or rotate it and contact
          us promptly.

          contact us (see section 1) or the organization that ran the event,
          and we will respond within one month. We may need to verify your
